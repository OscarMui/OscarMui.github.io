					p I have made some websites for my secondary school - St. Joseph's College. 
					p For example, as part of the Chinese Cultural Society, I suggested making a website for an online competition to facilitate Chinese learning during the COVID-19 outbreak in February 2020.
					p I chose KeystoneJS as a framework for my website, which is a Node.js framework that allowed me to work with databases and reuse repetitive code. It was more enjoyable to create the websites by writing code than dragging and dropping elements using online website creators, since the former offers increased flexibility. The satisfaction brought by my schoolmates joining the competition and trying out the website I made was irreplaceable.
					p I would like to give special thanks to Anders, an old boy of SJC who taught me how to use Git, WSL, and more web development skills including the mentioned framework.
					p Very sorry I could not provide the URLs here as these website are not my personal projects.

			+timelineElement("05","HyMinions","left")
				p I have been playing a game called Hypixel Skyblock since 2020. I created a website calculating the optimal setup to maximize offline income based on the real-time market price of the game.
				p I originally made this website just to fulfill my interest in Maths, coding, and the game. However, thanks to the promotion by Youtubers, the website is known to many Hypixel Skyblock players. Currently, it has over 500 daily viewers and it is generating a considerable amount of ad revenue! Being able to earn money through a passion project is a mircale to me.
