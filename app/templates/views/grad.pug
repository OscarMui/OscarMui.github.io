		p Time flies, the past six years in SJC has been wonderful. Thank you everyone in St. Joseph's, you have all made me a better person. 
		p As you might know, I am not particularly good at expressing myself, so I made this website. You can check out some of my major coding projects, my gaming preference etc.. By updating it frequently, I hope you can keep up with whatever I might be doing in the future, and keep contact even when I changed my phone or email :) 
		p It is a delightful trip down the memory lane. Thank you for visiting my website.
